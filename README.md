# Cyanogen3DS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joel16/Cyanogen3DS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joel16/Cyanogen3DS)
This project is still heavily a work in progress. It is an alternative custom GUI menu for Nintendo 3DS. This program is based off of my PSP project - CyanogenPSP.

###### A few notes:

If you use the 3dslink utility to launch Cyanogen3DS it gets stuck while launching with a blue bottom screen and debug text in the top. Try escaping this using the L+R+Down+B combo, hopefully it works.

Using START to exit doesn't quite work just yet, you need to escape with the same combo as above.

In the odd chance you use a CIA build (not official yet) then you WILL have issues (both mental issues and 3DS-related issues). Don't say you weren't warned.
